Clinical-Tree-Bank
==================

This repository hosts several linguistic annotation guidelines for clinical documents. Guidelines are copy-righted, but free for the community to use. We plan to add several types of annotations (Token, POS and Constituent) in WordFreak format on some clinical notes from the i2b2 NLP challenge to the repository. The access and use of the annotations will be governed by the i2b2 data use agreement which users need to sign.
